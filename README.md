This is an improved version of the level-set UCLA-LES in the [level-set-smoke-cloud](https://github.com/uclales/uclales/tree/level-set-smoke-cloud) branch. The main differences are that (i) this version couples scalar subgrid-scale fluxes to the level set in addition to advective fluxes and that (ii) subsidence is included in the level-set transport.

The code is set up to simulate a stratocumulus cloud field based on research flight 1 of the DYCOMS II field study as described by Stevens et al. [1].
